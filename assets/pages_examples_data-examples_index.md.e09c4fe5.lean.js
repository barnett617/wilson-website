Execute the image rotation pre-alignment before the scan rotation and scan amplitude pre-alignments. The latter two calibrations only work if the pattern is roughly aligned with the diagnostic camera x-axis (+/- 5 degrees). The image rotation pre-alignment is independent of the scan rotation pre-alignment, the descan gain alignment and the scan amplitude alignment, therefore it can be moved in front of those three.","created_at":"2023-06-15T14:09:20Z","updated_at":"2023-06-15T14:09:20Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nandishjpatel","id":46875149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODc1MTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46875149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandishjpatel","html_url":"https://github.com/nandishjpatel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandishjpatel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandishjpatel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandishjpatel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandishjpatel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandishjpatel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandishjpatel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandishjpatel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandishjpatel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandishjpatel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/delmic/odemis/pulls/2446/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/delmic/odemis/pulls/2446/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/delmic/odemis/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/delmic/odemis/issues/2446/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/delmic/odemis/statuses/68c1f4e0780a004bc501c419dd11d97115dc14f7","head":{"label":"tepals:fastem-change-order-calib1","ref":"fastem-change-order-calib1","sha":"68c1f4e0780a004bc501c419dd11d97115dc14f7","user":{"login":"tepals","id":46314774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzE0Nzc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46314774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tepals","html_url":"https://github.com/tepals","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tepals/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tepals/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tepals/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tepals/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tepals/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tepals/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tepals/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tepals/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tepals/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":163819191,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjM4MTkxOTE=","name":"odemis","full_name":"tepals/odemis","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tepals","id":46314774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzE0Nzc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46314774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tepals","html_url":"https://github.com/tepals","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tepals/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tepals/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tepals/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tepals/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tepals/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tepals/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tepals/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tepals/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tepals/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tepals/odemis","description":"Open
