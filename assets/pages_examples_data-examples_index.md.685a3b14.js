option is specified , the return value will be the new score of member (a double precision floating point number) represented as string, or nil if the operation was aborted (when called with either the XX or the NX option).\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso INCR works with only one member so even we give more priority to CH over INCR, the output will always be 1.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Proposed Solution** \\r\\nINCR and CH
